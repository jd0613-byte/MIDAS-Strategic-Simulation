# MIDAS v23.6: Joseph D. Arico Strategic Suite

MIDAS (Minimax-based Interactive Dynamic Assessment Simulation) is a comprehensive analytical platform designed to model the systemic decay of global actors across ten high-stakes flashpoints.



## 🚀 Strategic Overview
MIDAS utilizes a minimax-inspired assessment engine to calculate "Structural Integrity" based on friction, doctrine, and non-linear shocks.



## 📈 System Resilience: The Black Swan Engine
Version 23.6 introduces the **Black Swan Event Toggle**, allowing analysts to inject sudden, asymmetrical shocks (25-45% integrity loss) into the simulation. This tests not just the endurance of a system, but its fundamental resilience.



## 📂 Flashpoint Scenarios
1.  **Taiwan Strait Crisis**: Amphibious invasion and blockade logic.
2.  **Ukraine Attrition**: Sawtooth aid recovery and industrial endurance.
3.  **Kessler Event**: Debris cascades and technological interconnectedness.
4.  **Currency War**: Economic reserve hegemony and debt weaponization.
5.  ...and 6 more specialized strategic environments.



## 🛠️ Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run simulation: `python MIDAS_v23_6.py`
3. Review Post-Action Reports (PAR) for Root Cause Analysis (The "Why").

## 🆕 Version 23.7: The Modular Intelligence Update

The latest version of **MIDAS** (**M**inimax-based **I**nteractive **D**ynamic **A**ssessment **S**imulation) introduces a modular architecture designed for high-level strategic research.

### 🛠️ Key Architectural Changes:
* **Data/Logic Decoupling:** Strategic flashpoints are now stored in `scenarios.json`. This allows for rapid scenario expansion without modifying the simulation engine.
* **Resilience Analytics:** Enhanced modeling of systemic "brittleness" through the updated Black Swan engine.
* **Production-Ready Error Handling:** Integrated path verification to ensure stable execution across different OS environments.

### 📂 Repository Structure:
* `MIDAS_v23_7.py`: Core Simulation & Visualization Engine.
* `scenarios.json`: The Intelligence Database (10+ scenarios).
* `requirements.txt`: Environment dependencies.
